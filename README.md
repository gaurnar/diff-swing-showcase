# diff-swing-showcase

Simple Java Swing diff program written by me for job application. Do not expect much from it ;)

## Features

- Side-by-side comparison of text files
- Uses [Myers](https://neil.fraser.name/writing/diff/myers.pdf) algorithm for char by char comparison

## TODO

- File editing
- Toggle display of equal parts of files (hide/show)
- Char by char for some lines does not look as pretty as in e.g. IntelliJ IDEA

## How to build

This repository contains IntelliJ IDEA project. You have to use it to build JAR artifact.
